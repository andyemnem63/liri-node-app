  node dixby.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, DIXBY will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of DIXBY's commands.
It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.

BONUS

In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called log.txt.

Make sure you append each command you run to the log.txt file.

Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
